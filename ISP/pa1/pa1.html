      <p class="osu">
        osu! is a free to play rhythm game for computers that I have been playing for a few years.
        It is a community-driven game where users can upload songs and make what are known as maps
        (charts in other rhythm games) for them, which are the 'levels' that players play, and are
        supposed to be reflective of the song. <br>
        The music that gets uploaded to the game is very diverse and can range from anything from 
        pop to rock to genres you might not have even heard of, like artcore or neurofunk. There's music
        from every genre, so there's always something you can enjoy and new music for you to discover.
        In fact, some of my favorite songs I would not have discovered if it were not for osu!

      <h2>League Of Legends</h2>
      <hr>
      <p class="lol">
        League Of Legends (commonly referred to as 'LoL' or just 'League') is one of the most 
        popular free to play games in the world right now. It is a 'MOBA' where 2 teams of 5 
        players try to work together to systematically destroy the enemy base, winning the game. 
        Each player plays as a 'champion' (or 'champ' for short), with each champ having 4 usable
        abilities and 1 passive ability. <br>
        There are currently 145 different champions in the game, with each champion designed
        to play in 1 or 2 different roles.

      </p>

      <h2>Azur Lane</h2>
      <hr>
      <p class="boats">
        Azur Lane is a free to play mobile game that plays like a Danmaku (bullet hell) game. 
        You control your characters using a virtual joystick to dodge enemy bullets while your
        characters are shooting back at the enemy. <br>
        The characters in this game are anthromorphized World War II warships that are named 
        and characterized after various old warships from different countries, done in an anime 
        style. For example, the ingame character Laffey is based off of the USS Laffey, a Benson-
        class destroyer that served the US Navy during WWII. <br>
        The developers like to make alot of historical references with the in-game characters
        whenever they can. With Laffey, they decided to make her an alchoholic in-game to reference
        the fact that alot of the sailors on the historical USS Laffey were also alchoholics, who 
        went so far as to drink the fuel used for the ship's torpedoes after filtering it, since 
        the fuel was composed of 90% alchohol. <br>
        Another historical reference that I like is that the character design of the in-game HMS 
        Victorious (an Illustrious-class Aircraft Carrier developed by the British Royal Navy) 
        was inspired by the design used for the historical HMS Victorious's ship badge. <br>
        <br> The game uses 4 main categories of ships: Aircraft Carriers, Battleships, Cruisers, and
        Destroyers. Aircraft Carriers and Battleships are the big heavy hitters that have alot of health
        and deal alot of damage, but they are slow and their damage only comes in bursts so they
        need protecting. This protection comes from Cruisers and Destroyers who are much smaller
        but faster and deal more consistent damage over time. They are the ones you control the movement of 
        using the virtual joystick, allowing them to avoid enemy fire (unlike Carriers and Battleships). <br>
        Battle is done using fleets of ships that you put together. Each fleet has 2 parts to it. 
        There is a backline referred to as the 'Main Fleet' and a frontline referred to as the 'Escort 
        Fleet'. The Main Fleet consists of Aircraft Carriers and Battleships, while the Escort Fleet
        consists of Cruisers and Destroyers. Each part can contain up to 3 ships, for a total of 
        6 ships that you can take into battle.
